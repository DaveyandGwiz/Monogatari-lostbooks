I am worried I have too many threads going on in the first scene. Wedny's relatiionship with Liz, the ghost her lonliness, being a witch


The ghost should be more front and center. Maybe if I introduced it slightly later. 

Just write what happens. I can always come back to beautify.

I feel so pathetic.
SOme woman sat next to me at starbucks. SHe had been sitting there a while. I thought perhaps she was someohow in tereested in me.
She was of course waiting for her drink.

Why would I think people would pay any special attention to me. I guess the way I am dressed is a little unique today.
I'm dressed in my old green flanel and a black tank top that I like to think displays my physique.
But am I really so attentiojn grabbing, so cute?

No not really.
Why would I think that women would be paying special attention to me?
Because I'm deperate for them to. Desperate for attention, for positive attention, for approval, if even just in the form of a little smile.
To catch a glimpse of a side glance so that my mind can imagine. Imagine if perhaps this or that beautiful stranger had some interest in me.
So that I can continue to live without other humans but with fule for the imagination of what could have been.

I am in truth depeply lonely deeply discontent with my life in many respects.
But everytime it seems I reach out to others I am met with so much frustration and diasapointment.
I remeind myself of the pain, so that I lose motivation to do it again: reach out for warth.

Reach out for warmth.. its an apt description. What is the pain I feel other than the hardwored need to be with others to be aroudn them so they
can ensure my survbival,
I spend money at restaurants. at bars at coffee shops to placate this.
