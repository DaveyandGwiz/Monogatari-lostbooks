 Elizabeth said snapping her fingers.

 Haha, yeah sorry you were saying?

* 	Wendy hears a “ghost” in the school’s library

Uhhhh, earth to Wendy. Elizabeth said and sanpped her fingers in Wendy's face.

Oh, ha-ha, Wendy awkwardly chuckled coming out of it and looking again at Elizabeth.

You heard it again, didnt you? 
Wendy rolled her eyes around nervoously. Uh,no?

Elizabeth and Wendy had stopped dead in their tracks; they stood in front of the exit of Jupiter middle school.
the bell had rung and studnts around manuevred around the duo as they made their way out. Easger to enjoy the long weekend.

Elizabeth paid them no heed. and elizabeth squinted her eyes as she focused on wendy.

Just thinking, huh? And what were you thinking about? Was it ghosts, per chance?

No no, wendy said nornvouly. She rattled the toy box of her inner mind trying to come up with an convincing alternative.
I was just thinking...about the ritual!
About the ritual? Oh, the spell?

Ritual. Wendy corrected her. Not exactly a spell. A spell always has an intention to effect the world around you. A ritual
is just a performance, a way to communicate with the divine. 
// good place to stop I need to figure out what wendy had invited Elizabeth to do. Some kind of ritual. That's the word I should use: ritual.
Uh huh. Elizabeth gave a unipired nod.

They started walking. Wendy slung her backpack over her shoulder  and gave it a proud slap, emphazizing it's fullness.
Are you excited, I'm ready to go straight to you place if you are ready. I'm sure if you wanted to stop by the smoothie shop before
heading home, I dont have any money right now, but I dont mind coming along. I'll just give you moreinformation in  prpearation 
for the ritual. I on,y gave you the bare monimum last time. But there's so much more to it!

Uh, huh. Elizabeth aknowledge somewhat exaperated.

Just then, as Elizabeth and Wendy approached the curb, a convertable pulled up several girls in there same grade started waving
At elizabeth of course.

hey, Liz, come on, you coming or what?

Elizabeth turned to Wendy, Hey wendy sorry I forgot I made plans to hand out with Emily and her friends tonight,
we're going Ice skating. Hope we can do the spell later?

Wendy both shocked and dispointed looked at the car and back at liz before forcing a smile
 forced herself to smile. It's no problem Liz. Yeah, can do the ritual later.

Without another word elizabth ran forward and hopped in the back of the convertbel. The girls slidng out of the way to make room for her.

The car pulled off the girls giggling as they sped forward. Wendy suspected some of the laughs might have bben directed at her,
not that would be anything new.

Wendy watched the car drive off forlornly. Wendy understood that things came up, and she had no trouble doing the ritual later.
But couldnt have liz asked wendy if she wanted to go?

It wasbt as if wendy expected it, but would it have killed Liz to invite Wendy once?
Not that she had any inteest in hanging out with a bunch of girly girls anyhow.

Wendy shook her head, the fact that a girl as popular as Liz would hang out with Wendy at all was something she was grateful for.
At jupiter middle school there werent exactly a lot of kids willing to a associate with a witch.

Wendy lloked back at the school grounds plotting her next step, it seemed that the plans for the evening had been changed.
But going home wasnt an option, and how could she waste this opprotunity to cast under the new moon? 
-------------------------
The school grounds had about cleared comepletely at this point 
// I missed the beat about the new moon.
Then wendy heard it again.

She turned back towards the school at could see the staff closing up for the day. 
On the outside, everything apppeared normaly at least to other people.
// i'd like wendy to find a bench to sit on or something. Maybe could work on a spell/tarot or something.
It was almost 5pm and most of the students had left at this point. The parking slowly emptied, and what few indivudals were by
carried on as they normally do.

Not a single one of them could hear what wendy heard: the long lound haunting howl.
How it echoed from outside the school like  the alarm system was off.

no matter how many times wendy heard it she couldnt bring herself to ignore it. How could she? With it's otherwordly howl
the very sound of which shook wendy to her core.

Wendy frowned and looked at her phone to check the time.  
----------------------------

The sound of the rushing crowds subsided, leaving a desolotae parking lot in its place.
The school grounds had cleared and what few individuals were there consisted primarly of staff locking up doors and leaving for the day.

There was a lump in her throuat and she sat down her bag to cover her ears. She looked at the main enterance as the janitor shut the door 
for the day, carrying on as there was nothing unusual. To him there likely was nothing that seemed out of the ordinary.
Only wendy could hear it: The loud long ambient screech, its haunting, uneartlhy howl that eminated from the library.

Only she could hear the ghost that haunted Jupiter middle school.



---------

// Wendy goes out to the park in the woods.
// how does she prepare her spell? Does she light a fire?

A new moon.

Wendy looked up at the night sky a fresh ensusiaium.
She had been looking forward to this night for months now. // I'm just going to make stuff up for now. Get the feeling down. 
The new moon provided the hight of magical power for a witch like wendy at least for the type of spell she had planned to cast.
// I want to work on the through line of the lonliness and the ghost. Right now things feel dijointed but that happens, doesnt it?

LOooking around her she found herself deep in the woods, with the only company being the night sky. She had planned on using this location,
but had planned to be accompanied by Liz. Standing out in the woods by herself, wendy felt uneasy, but the sight of the new moon gave her a 
sense of renwed courage. She had a purpose a divine one.

The appearance of a new moon marked the beggining of the nxt lunar cycle. It was a new beggining, and a good little witch like wendy 
new that such a night was the opprotune chance to cast a such a spell.
 A spell that marked a new beggining.

 Wendyy took from her bag a sereis of stones and ith them formed the star of david a holy symbol acknowledge by magic users.

 she took the insnse from her bag, hoolywood leavs, myrr, and a dash of cinnamon, wendy smiled as she took a long breath of the sweet herbs 
 before striking a match and light a candle to place on the center.
 in her palms she held two simple metal rings. she outstretched her open palms over the flam nd let the smoke putify the rings.

 One ring was for wendy and the other was for liz. At least it was going to be.

 Tonights spell the product of many hours of comtemplation of wendy was a ritual to both celebrate the beging of there friendship and
 to ask the goddess of the moon to bless and preserve it.

 Wnedy stretched her open palms outward to the moon goddess. 

 A subtle frown spread across wendys face. She had memorized the mantra, but now she wasnt sure.
 This Was the spell to cast friendship but was Liz that friend. Here she was in the woods to cast a spell to bless a friendship 
 only one friend was not here. Wendy kept her palms outstretched and stared up to the moon pleadingly.

 A wish was on her lips, but she could not explain it.

 The longing for friendship with Liz or really just a friend of some sort, a friend who could understand her, who would need her like she
 needed a friend.

 Not to mention the haunting at her school!

 // I want to go back to something close to my original beggining. Liz is quite vexxed about wndy hearing the ghost, and they discuss it.

 // It becomes clear through their conversation about the ghost that Liz is quite vexxed, only hu,ors wendy, and wendy is quite obseessed.
 // Wendy wants to stop bringing up the ghost she fears it is pushing Liz away. It only makes her more strange.

 Her firnedship with Liz, if liz even was her firnd, her need for a friend, not to mention the hauntinng at school.
 Wendy stared into the night sky pleadingly.

 What could she ask the moon godess for? What should she ask.

 She took a deep breathe and dropping her script spoke from her soul.
// let me be a friend, to someone in need.  to let the lonely time end, so mote it be!
 

 -- Later that noght or the next day.

 // Does wendy wake up? Or does she go home late? 
 If she goes home late, the scene settles down. 
 If she wakes up, then we carry on to Wendy leaving to the school and meeting the kids 
// I'll go with the later.

Wendy rubbed at her eyes. She felt

Feeling wide-awake she stood up from her bed. looking out the blinds she observed the darkness outside. She turned to her clock 3:35am.
much earlier than she planned to get up, perhaps it was divine providence.
Feeling wide awake she went ahead and got out of bed. turning to her small cubby desk she turns on her lamp and lights a stick of insence
matching for an early saturday morning. She pulls out a small wooden box with a symbol engraved on it; she consoles her orcale.

from the box, she retrieves her oracle. old worn cards of tarot. From the sun tained backs and faded ink the cards seemed especially old.
To wendy, this age only enhanced her estimation that these thin cards contained much wisdom.

circuling thestck around the deck, to incase it in a ring of smoke. Wendy annoited her oracle, and placed her palm on her deck. Closing her eyes she
focused. On her desire. 
Oh, oracle, wendy said. You know what lies ahead of me today, please give me wisdom for what ever lies aahead of me today.
She shuffled her deck and spilt the deck in half one last time. She drew the card.
Two of Cups in reverse.

Two of Cups? wendy furrowed her brow and focuesed on it's art. The card depicted two persons thought to be lovers exchanging their grials in 
contened expressions shown on there faces. 
The card symbolzed partenership, compatibility, love, engagement.

Now wendy drew the reverse of this, the card upside down. In tarot, to draw a card upside down changed the way in which an individual was to interpret the symbol.
Typically, the reverse of a card suggested a reading which was opposite or at the very least complementary to the card's typical meaning.

Wendy sat the card down and frowned as she pondered this.

The opoosite of partenship, the reverse of paretenship of peace a need. Wendy frowned.
So is tarot suggesting lonliness? She chuckled. She didnt need to consult an oracle to know that.

She picked up her book on tarot meanings and tumbed throught the pages till she reched the page on the two of cups. 

The two of cups can also mean a need to focus on one's relatonshoip to ones self...

What could this me?
While never questioning or unaappreciating of the wisom reveled by the cards, wendy sighed as she read this.
It seemed an unfortunate omen. Lonlieness.... An omen that she would meet anyone during her secret misson to the library today?

She sighed. But after putting away her cards determindly started packing her things anyway. She slipped on her old red hoodie which she wore everyday.
And slung her heavy bag over her sholder. It was still early but the early the better for seeing to her mission today. 

Silently she crept out of her room, into the living area. Hereing a sharp metalic, crunch under her feat Wndy observed the empty beer bottles strewn across the floor.

Walking by the sofa she found David miserably spead out across the sofa. bottle still in hand.

I guess the date didnt go well huh?
Wendy said her voice  tinged with a saddened disgust.

She shifted her pag and silently slipped throught the door.

2.

Wendy walked down the street for 20 minutes. As the sun crept up the sky, the clouds became ornaments on a canvas of all shades from 
vilet to red

The heavy set bag weighed down on Wendys shoulders. She constantly shifted around the straps to avoid the havy strain.
The jupiter middle school was not the closest school nearby, but after an unfortiunate bullying incident two years ago, 
It was selected as wendys best choice when entering middle school.

At any rate, the walk would take an hour, but at least at this point wendy was halfway there. 
Her plan required stleath and so required an early start.
// I forgot the scene where wendy decides to try to locate the ghost once and for all.
Wendy was lonely wendy was after all different from most girls her age.
When wendy first met Liz she couldnt imagine that Liz was anything more than a case study.
An animal to be studied. Nerdious outcastus. A rare speciemen.
// I think I get the distance now, the narration sounds nothing like wendy. The narrator is not wnedy.
// What would different style of narration feel like?

Over time, however, Wendy was suprised to find what she thought was something like a kindred spirit in Liz.
Liz had been thrileed to meet a real witch, and wendy was peased as a peach to have someone to share her knowledge
of all things magical with. 
Not that there where never times where Liz seemed bogged down with Wendy's diatirbes into the paranormal.
It seemed to be going more or less well until Wendy started hearing it. and it seemed to be the fina straw.

It was only three months ago but to wendy it felt almost the like something that had plagued her for years.

The shrieking haundt that echoed through out the school towards the cloe of everyday.
The earthereal  howl that echoed from the schools library.

Wendy had practiced whichcraft from a young age, that tradition along with her worn red hoodie, were the sole possessions left to wendy by her mother.

Wendy had prectised the craft in isolation from a young age, and while she liked to believe she had had her fair share of experiences 
that touched upon the ordinary there was never something so sudden that gripped her.

Wendy had bothered to ask and as far as she could tell she wwas the only one in all of Jupiter who could hear thte dicrete howl.
As clear as a bell. The sound so distinnct and unlike anything wendy had ever heard.

Even wendy began to doubt when she found that Liz could not hear it. Here hearing was perfectly normal as far as she and the school nurse could tell.
It took wnedy some time to realize that only she could here the sound and that it wasnt all part of some elabort prank to 
mence the wicked witch.

Wendy would spend an hour in the library after school everyday, casting spelss trying to make contact.

A sound so ethereal so other worldly, could only belong to a ghost. 
A banshee she reasoned. A sort of disembodied ghost.

Wendy did her research, and attemtoed all known ways to soothe and communicate with such an apprition. To no avail.

The daily attempts at communication wore down Wendy, and ironically, only served to further isolate her.

Well, I'm going to go ahead and head home wendy. See you whenever... Liz would say. Unammused by Wendys growing fixation on the ghost
// I want to open the story with wendy staunchly trying to deny any interest in the ghost and Liz vexxed by the whole ordeal.

Everyday, ghost this haunt that. I really think you should see an ear doctor wendy. Or a psychologist at the very least.
Wouldnt ear doctor be the very least.

Wnedy had three main theories: 1) the ghost hell bent on tormenting specifically wendy,
3) she evidently had a superior doglike sense of hearing whch allowed here to hear things normal humans couldnt
4) there was something the ghost wasnt ready to communcate yet or was unleast undecided on what to say next
Well, and there was always the possibilty that she had just lost her marbles 
But for now, 3 was her working theory.

As far as wendy knew she had done everything possible to inititiate communcation with a banshee.
It was ultimately up to the ghost the make the next move.
Though wendy liked to think of herself as patient, the past months had been draining, and the concern with Liz
had been the final straw. Wendy was going to wait in the library all day if she had to, and if the ghost didnt have anything to say.
She was just going to ignore it from now on.

15 minuetes away from the school and the sun was already high in the sky. The sun started beating down and wendy was glad to know she'd be out of the sun soon.

Not far from the school wendy walked with her eyes to the ground as she contemplated her next move.

The first step would be to slip into the library. Wendy was comfident she'd find a way to do this as there was a series of doors that wendy knew were routinely
unlocked througout the school. 
The next move however still questioned wendy. How would wendy provoke the ghost to comminucate.
The specture was on a timeline, would it be fair to let it know this was the last chance? Or perhaps wendy had been to forceful.
Walking into the library casting spells attempting to communicate, perhaps listening and being receptive would be the best course of action.
Wendy contemplated these things, till a plastic wheeel ran direclty acroess her front foot.

And wendy shrieked out more from shock than in pain. catching herself from falling over Wendy looked up toe find her selof face to face with the culprit.

A small boy on a blue hollow plastic tricycle.

uh, heelo?
The boy stopped in front of wendy and stared at her blankly as he sloppiky sucked on a lolipop that seemed to be about as large as his head.

He kicked the peddle and the fron wheel was agin over wendy foot.

Hu, thaats my foot you know?
Wendy oulled back her foot and crept down to look at the boy.
Can you talk yet? The boy was very young looking to be about 4 or 5. Getting a better look at the Boy Wendy realized who it was 
// wendy is very affectionate towards young kids.
oh, its you! wendy smiled do you remember me?

Wendy bent over to picked the boy, who immediately grabbed hold of wendy as if she were his mother.
The intense stickines of his little fingers could be felt even throun wendys heavy jacket.

It's me wnedy! I babysat you and your older brother. Do you remember me?
// If wnedy is in middle school she isnt old enogh to baby sit.
Just as wendy said this, the sound of wheels dragged through gravel sounded and wendy looked around to find herlf surround 
by a formidable group of first graders. And from the look on their faces, they seemed less than hospitable.

Let my brother go you witch!

Wendy smiled, Hey Alex, how are you wendy said smiling?

I'm ok Alex said casually before shaking his head and looking at the other kids around him.
But but I need you to put my brother down. He isnt an ingreinet for you took cook in your witch's coauldron.

Are you sure she's a witch? a girl Madeline said next to Alex and pistione don her own trike.

She sure doesnt look like a withh. Dont witches have green skin and ride around on brooms?

// How will I introduce the boy who wants to hunt the ghost?

Wendy laughed still holding onto alexs brother. and shook her head.

No, no, real witches dont have green skin and fly aroudn on brooms. 
Witches dont need to look any sort of way to be witches.

So is it true that your a which? One of the other kids who had been silent spoke.

You bet! Wendy said with a sense of pride, much to shock of the children.

Can you cast spells? 
Everyday, wendy replied.

Well... Went madeline.. Why dont you cast a spell right now? That'll prove if youre a real witch or not.
Yeah cast a spell.
Make Timothy disapear, then tht'll prove if youre a real witch of not.

Wendy chuckled, exasperated.
But werent you trying to prevent me using my witchcraft on timothy?

Only make him disapear till it's time to go home, Alex said. Then you can bring him back.

I could defintely cast a spell, Wendy said, but I dont have time today, I'm in a bit of a hurry. And she sat timmy down next to his trike.

Were you headed off anyway Alex demeand.

Well, if you must know, I'm looking for a ghost.

Gohst?! The children gasped in unison.

Like a haunted mansion.

Library actually.

Like a white legless blanket over its head spook?

Probably not but I couldnt say for sure.

The they type of monster thatll posses you and control your soul forever?

Wendy shuddred. I hope not, she thought.

Wendy stepped forward and and placed her hand over her chest.
As a witch, she said, I see it as my duty to act as an itememidiary between the human world and the super natural.

// how can I introduce the ghost hunter boy? Is it alex? maybe, his little brother has been getting
// all the attention, and he thinks finding a ghost will bring him attention.

Alex squinted his eyes at wendy in skeptical fashion. 
Yeah, he scoffed, but what exactly makes you think you found a ghsot anyway, have you ever seen a ghost?

Well.. uh.. no wendy admitted. But the signs are all there! I'm a witch after all!
I have a sixth sense about these things.

A witch who cant cast spells, Alex repeated. 

Make timmy disapear he demanded
// maybe the other kids could explain to wendy that alex is grumpy that his little brother is getting all the attention
// or perhaps alex could get his own chapeter 

Well I need to get going Wendy said, rembering her mission.

The kids started heading while Alex stayed behind with a careful eye he watched wendy as she headed down the street.
// heres my issue: i'm not emeressed in the story.

One of Alex's friends Emily, stopped turning back she said, you coming alex? 

But alex didnt hear, in his head he envisoned himself, Alex the ghost hunter.
What if wnedy was ine to something? What if he could be there one to discover the ghost and reveal it to the world?

Hey, Emily, you mind watching timmy for a while? I want to go check on something...



--  Wendy goes to school to look for ghost if only for last time

Wendy's heavy bag made a loud thump as she dropped it on the ground before the school.

She had finally ariived. Exected she wiped her her sleeve against the drops of sweat on her 
forehead. Already exerted, but wendy realized she didnt have time to waste. Now was the real work to be done.
Step one of which was in fultrating the school's library.

She walked around the schhool yard to heaed to the door she had thought was left open.
She leaned forward to open the door when it flew open. Wendy shot back to avoid being hit.
For a split second she worried that her mission would be postponed but was realized when she was met with a familar face.
It was the school's janitor Janny.

Oh, Wendy, Glad to see you! He said and his bright smile somehow managed to increase the the wrinkles on his aged face.

Despite being a new student to Jupiter, wendy had know janny for as long as she could remember.
// Change school name to Harvey
He had been the janitor of wendy's middle school as well.

Headed to the library Wendy.

Janny said with a wide smile. 

haha.. I laughed nervously, Well I'm just walking around but if you wouldnt mind.

Janny, had let me stay late in the library a few times.
Even letting me stay past close saying just to make sure the door closes behind me.
I always just tell Janny I'm staying late to study and he seems more that welcoming to allow me.

Janny puts down his broom and I follow him inside.

He pulls the large ring of keys of off his waist and opens the libary door.

Stay as long as you'd like Wendy. Janny says eagerly.

It does my heart good to see a student working so hard Janny says as I place down my heavy bag of books.

I tell Janny I'm just studying at the truth is that while my reading hasnt been related to homework, I have been doing a fair share of research.

I sit down at one of the tables seated down at the center of the library and take out my notebook.

Janny starts making his wauy to the door.

I imagine you might be hear late Wendy janny says, just dont be working too hard. A girl your age needs to make time for her friends as well.

I drop my head down. Thanks Janny, haha to be honest, I like spending time alone with books.
Janny smiles, oh I you wont be here alone wnedy // I dont like this 

I finish pulling out my things and janny makes his way to the door.

Opening my book, I sgtared to read. Aticipating I might be here a while. The library door opens and I here janny call out.
Well, we all need someone to talk to at sometime, I turn my head to the door but see that Janny had already closed it behind him 
as he is nowhere to be sceen.

and return to my book before setting it back down.

"We all need to talk to somebody, when were ready.."

// what is something janny could say that eludes to the ghst?
// indicate that there might be someone else around?


Thump.

Ah
I jot my head up awake when one of the many heavy volumes I brought wirth me falls off the table.
I sit up, and see scarlet rays of light beaming through the window. Sundown already.
I sigh with a deep feeling of defeat. 10 hours...
I'd been sitting here to no avail.

I look despondent at the volmuios notes of letters scribbled into my notebook.
Nothing legible. All attempts at communicating with the ghost seemed fruitlesss.
I obviously have no nack for mediumship. 

I step up and peer out the windo towards the school parking lot. Not a single car or human soul in sight.
It then appears to me how lonely I feel within the library. a cold sensation shivers through my body and I rub my eyes for warcmth.

I cant stay here much longer I guess. I'm sure david will interegate me if I stay here too late.
I sigh, looking at the setting sun. Well I defintely gave it the old college try...

I look around the empty library sentimentally. 
Despite the lack of paranormal activit`y I still cant doubt it.
It's beyond rational explanation, but for reasosn I cant explain I know deep in the depths of my soul that somewhere inside this library.
There is a ghost, a sould, a supernatural enityt calling out pleading to be heard. But for whaterver reason not heard today.

A sympathetic smile spreads across my face and I decide to take a fial stroll around the musty beige metal shelves before leaving for the day.

I look at our schools modest collection of books under the section labled folklore.
I giggle when I see the mostly emptied shelf. As it stands most of the volumes that typically rest there are inside my back pack.

I decide to go ahead and grab my books from off of the table and start placing them on the shelf.
I'm figure I might as well do the librarian a favor, Emily. She's the only person who works in this library. I'm suprised she doesnt spend 
all day putting books away. I cant imagine how she does it.

I put away the volumes and placing down the final following the order indicated on the spine, I sit up and wipe my hands,
I think I'm doing it right. I stand up and wipe my hands.
// Wendy needs to have her books present to show casper. Well actually that comes later, when wendy knows casper is a ghost.

Heading to the door I take one last look at the library.
I smile. I start to think about the ghost haunting this library. How long had they been here?
How long had they even waited till someone came by who could hear them.
I thought about how long they might have waited. And here I was about ready to give up on the ghost.
I realize how selfish I'd been, to think of only myself. When I should have been here for the lonely lost soul.
"Whenever you want to talk... I'll be ready"


I say and start making my way out the door when it catches my attention.
The ambient howl, the ereal tune, the otherworldly song.

It's here. And it;;s not just here its here here.
As loud as ever, and for the first time I can pin point it. I dash into the darkened library almost tripping over one of the small seats.
I look up its coming from the second floor of the library, over in the section with all the picture books.
I get closer and start making my way through the shelves, I turn my head. There I say. I can hear it coming from behind one of the books 
shelves the area where all the picture books are.

The closer I get to the source of the noise the clearer it becomes. I creep forward and with every inch I make towards the shel the 
howl... it starts to lose its other worldly quality.
becoming less vibrant less myterious and more... Human?
It human. I approach the shelf and can here the heavy breathing the subtle wimpering a shiver comes 
through my body as I listen to the strained breathes. I realize I am not in the library alone. There is another person in the library in here with me.

It takes a real witch to feel more afraid of a huamn that a ghost.

My legs jolt and I have to fight the urge to run out of the library immediately,
but I cant stop now. After all this time after all time spent trying to find the source of this haunt.

EVen if it is just somebody who broke inside the libary and has been hiding here. I have to at least get a glane 
I have to at least take a look at the owner of this voice.
I have to see with my own eyes What ever lies behind that shelf is.
As silent as a mouse I bend down onto my knees in the darkend library.

And slowly slowy peer past the bookshelf

I squint my eyes to make out the figure in the dimly lit library. Do my eyess deceive me?

I see a boy... A boy about my age... and he's cryig...

Hundled into the corner. He pressing his chest against his knees. Shaking he he whimpers violents its a pathetic sight.

I feel so diarmed by his feeble appearance that without even think I stand and walk past the shelf.

the the boy lloks up briefly and looks in my direction, strangely he pays me no mind and continues his maning.
As if my appearance means nothing to him.
What a strange boy I think and take in his freatures.

His hair is light blonde like mine as before I dyed it. and long enough on the sides to reach the nip of his neck.
His skin is rudy and slightly freckled as if he spends many hours in the sun.

his clothing is stangre. A worn plaid shirt with even ruddier slacks held up by suspends that run up his back and across his shoudlers.

He looked like a boy straight out of a farmers story book.
Curious about the boy a take a few steps forward, still quielty.

I begin to wonder why such a boy is doing in this librayr so late.

Then it occurs to me, is this boy lost? Homeless?
The pieces are starting to come together.
Perhaps this boy had ran away from home. And he'd been hiding in the library after school. 

the the boy lloks up briefly and looks in my direction, strangely he pays me no mind and continues his maning.
As if my appearance means nothing to him.

He remains in his slumped position. Showing no indication of moving feeling more at I approach the boy.

Hey... I let out weakly but he pays no mind
// maybe casper is mumbuling something under his breathe? Going on about something
// Wendy thinks what casper is saying is pathetic not that his appearance is pathetic

Hey. I speak more loudly. I get no response.
He continues mumbling under his breath "..."
Is it possible he cant hear me?
I lean down towards the boy and lean foward hey I say again and wave at him slowly
// casper is sitting at a table
This time he looks at me, in disbelief

yoo hoo I smile and continue waving.
he looks behind himself almost as if he expects to see someone there then back at me.
Yes you I m talking to you.

You were crying... I say and sit across from him at the table. Is everything ok?...

He stares at me wide eyed his eyes puffy from his earlier tears.

He looks back behind himself then back to me.. He does this a few more times before 
finally opening his mouth.
you can see me? his says as he points his shaking finger towards himself.

I cant help but laugh. I cant help but find The boys nervousness and shock funny, 
yes I can see you. I giggle.

He waves his hand in a slow methodical manner. I raise my hand to follow his I lean forward to clap his hand but he qucikly widrws.

But how can you see me?

Because i have eyes? I say still laughing at the ruddy boys shock.

he puts his hand to his chins and seems to deeply ponder this.

Amusment aside, I remember the state of the situation and my smile  turns cold as I think on the sitiuation of this 
gritty, despondent boy.


You were crying earlier.. I say
Who me? he says defensively and rbus his sleevs across his eyes.
I think I just had something in my eye. He straightens his body as a sort of macho facade pails over.

It must be a sensitve topic. Just about anyboy would feel ashamed to be seen crying and I cant imagine this one is any exception.

So... What are you doing here the boy says seeming to want to schange the subject. Do you uh come to the library often?

Yes I say curiously, thrown of by the boys akward attempt to change the topic.

I want to ask the boy all the improtant questions why is he here, how long he's been here, if he needs a place to go.
But I resist the urge. After all, this boy is in all likliehood in a rather strange situation.
Who am I to him that he would reveal hi secrets so quickly.

I take the bait I'm willing to follow this conversation whereever its headed.

I'm a student here, I say you?

I'm not sure... He says apearing confused. I think I used to be.

How do you not know, I respond.

I think I used to be?

Used to be?

This boy couldntg be much alder than me, for all I know he could be younger.

whats your name he asks again chnging the subject.

Wendy... Good.

Your last name is good? he says.

Yeah, its my mothers last name its what I prefer to go by anyway.

You dont go by your fathers last name? He says suprised.

I shake my head, My father isnt around. 
Casper gives a long pause I'm sorry.. he says his face filled with genouine sympathy
At that moment I relaize something about this boy. He might be socially akward
