 Elizabeth said snapping her fingers.

 Haha, yeah sorry you were saying?

* 	Wendy hears a “ghost” in the school’s library

Uhhhh, earth to Wendy. Elizabeth said and sanpped her fingers in Wendy's face.

Oh, ha-ha, Wendy awkwardly chuckled coming out of it and looking again at Elizabeth.

You heard it again, didnt you? 
Wendy rolled her eyes around nervoously. Uh,no?

Elizabeth and Wendy had stopped dead in their tracks; they stood in front of the exit of Jupiter middle school.
the bell had rung and studnts around manuevred around the duo as they made their way out. Easger to enjoy the long weekend.

Elizabeth paid them no heed. and elizabeth squinted her eyes as she focused on wendy.

Just thinking, huh? And what were you thinking about? Was it ghosts, per chance?

No no, wendy said nornvouly. She rattled the toy box of her inner mind trying to come up with an convincing alternative.
I was just thinking...about the ritual!
About the ritual? Oh, the spell?

Ritual. Wendy corrected her. Not exactly a spell. A spell always has an intention to effect the world around you. A ritual
is just a performance, a way to communicate with the divine. 
// good place to stop I need to figure out what wendy had invited Elizabeth to do. Some kind of ritual. That's the word I should use: ritual.
Uh huh. Elizabeth gave a unipired nod.

They started walking. Wendy slung her backpack over her shoulder  and gave it a proud slap, emphazizing it's fullness.
Are you excited, I'm ready to go straight to you place if you are ready. I'm sure if you wanted to stop by the smoothie shop before
heading home, I dont have any money right now, but I dont mind coming along. I'll just give you moreinformation in  prpearation 
for the ritual. I on,y gave you the bare monimum last time. But there's so much more to it!

Uh, huh. Elizabeth aknowledge somewhat exaperated.

Just then, as Elizabeth and Wendy approached the curb, a convertable pulled up several girls in there same grade started waving
At elizabeth of course.

hey, Liz, come on, you coming or what?

Elizabeth turned to Wendy, Hey wendy sorry I forgot I made plans to hand out with Emily and her friends tonight,
we're going Ice skating. Hope we can do the spell later?

Wendy both shocked and dispointed looked at the car and back at liz before forcing a smile
 forced herself to smile. It's no problem Liz. Yeah, can do the ritual later.

Without another word elizabth ran forward and hopped in the back of the convertbel. The girls slidng out of the way to make room for her.

The car pulled off the girls giggling as they sped forward. Wendy suspected some of the laughs might have bben directed at her,
not that would be anything new.

Wendy watched the car drive off forlornly. Wendy understood that things came up, and she had no trouble doing the ritual later.
But couldnt have liz asked wendy if she wanted to go?

It wasbt as if wendy expected it, but would it have killed Liz to invite Wendy once?
Not that she had any inteest in hanging out with a bunch of girly girls anyhow.

Wendy shook her head, the fact that a girl as popular as Liz would hang out with Wendy at all was something she was grateful for.
At jupiter middle school there werent exactly a lot of kids willing to a associate with a witch.

Wendy lloked back at the school grounds plotting her next step, it seemed that the plans for the evening had been changed.
But going home wasnt an option, and how could she waste this opprotunity to cast under the new moon? 
-------------------------
The school grounds had about cleared comepletely at this point 
// I missed the beat about the new moon.
Then wendy heard it again.

She turned back towards the school at could see the staff closing up for the day. 
On the outside, everything apppeared normaly at least to other people.
// i'd like wendy to find a bench to sit on or something. Maybe could work on a spell/tarot or something.
It was almost 5pm and most of the students had left at this point. The parking slowly emptied, and what few indivudals were by
carried on as they normally do.

Not a single one of them could hear what wendy heard: the long lound haunting howl.
How it echoed from outside the school like  the alarm system was off.

no matter how many times wendy heard it she couldnt bring herself to ignore it. How could she? With it's otherwordly howl
the very sound of which shook wendy to her core.

Wendy frowned and looked at her phone to check the time.  
----------------------------

The sound of the rushing crowds subsided, leaving a desolotae parking lot in its place.
The school grounds had cleared and what few individuals were there consisted primarly of staff locking up doors and leaving for the day.

There was a lump in her throuat and she sat down her bag to cover her ears. She looked at the main enterance as the janitor shut the door 
for the day, carrying on as there was nothing unusual. To him there likely was nothing that seemed out of the ordinary.
Only wendy could hear it: The loud long ambient screech, its haunting, uneartlhy howl that eminated from the library.

Only she could hear the ghost that haunted Jupiter middle school.



---------

// Wendy goes out to the park in the woods.
// how does she prepare her spell? Does she light a fire?

A new moon.

Wendy looked up at the night sky a fresh ensusiaium.
She had been looking forward to this night for months now. // I'm just going to make stuff up for now. Get the feeling down. 
The new moon provided the hight of magical power for a witch like wendy at least for the type of spell she had planned to cast.
// I want to work on the through line of the lonliness and the ghost. Right now things feel dijointed but that happens, doesnt it?

LOooking around her she found herself deep in the woods, with the only company being the night sky. She had planned on using this location,
but had planned to be accompanied by Liz. Standing out in the woods by herself, wendy felt uneasy, but the sight of the new moon gave her a 
sense of renwed courage. She had a purpose a divine one.

The appearance of a new moon marked the beggining of the nxt lunar cycle. It was a new beggining, and a good little witch like wendy 
new that such a night was the opprotune chance to cast a such a spell.
 A spell that marked a new beggining.

 Wendyy took from her bag a sereis of stones and ith them formed the star of david a holy symbol acknowledge by magic users.

 she took the insnse from her bag, hoolywood leavs, myrr, and a dash of cinnamon, wendy smiled as she took a long breath of the sweet herbs 
 before striking a match and light a candle to place on the center.
 in her palms she held two simple metal rings. she outstretched her open palms over the flam nd let the smoke putify the rings.

 One ring was for wendy and the other was for liz. At least it was going to be.

 Tonights spell the product of many hours of comtemplation of wendy was a ritual to both celebrate the beging of there friendship and
 to ask the goddess of the moon to bless and preserve it.

 Wnedy stretched her open palms outward to the moon goddess. 

 A subtle frown spread across wendys face. She had memorized the mantra, but now she wasnt sure.
 This Was the spell to cast friendship but was Liz that friend. Here she was in the woods to cast a spell to bless a friendship 
 only one friend was not here. Wendy kept her palms outstretched and stared up to the moon pleadingly.

 A wish was on her lips, but she could not explain it.

 The longing for friendship with Liz or really just a friend of some sort, a friend who could understand her, who would need her like she
 needed a friend.

 Not to mention the haunting at her school!

 // I want to go back to something close to my original beggining. Liz is quite vexxed about wndy hearing the ghost, and they discuss it.

 // It becomes clear through their conversation about the ghost that Liz is quite vexxed, only hu,ors wendy, and wendy is quite obseessed.
 // Wendy wants to stop bringing up the ghost she fears it is pushing Liz away. It only makes her more strange.

 Her firnedship with Liz, if liz even was her firnd, her need for a friend, not to mention the hauntinng at school.
 Wendy stared into the night sky pleadingly.

 What could she ask the moon godess for? What should she ask.

 She took a deep breathe and dropping her script spoke from her soul.
// let me be a friend, to someone in need.  to let the lonely time end, so mote it be!
 

 -- Later that noght or the next day.

 // Does wendy wake up? Or does she go home late? 
 If she goes home late, the scene settles down. 
 If she wakes up, then we carry on to Wendy leaving to the school and meeting the kids 
// I'll go with the later.

Wendy rubbed at her eyes. She felt

Feeling wide-awake she stood up from her bed. looking out the blinds she observed the darkness outside. She turned to her clock 3:35am.
much earlier than she planned to get up, perhaps it was divine providence.
Feeling wide awake she went ahead and got out of bed. turning to her small cubby desk she turns on her lamp and lights a stick of insence
matching for an early saturday morning. She pulls out a small wooden box with a symbol engraved on it; she consoles her orcale.

from the box, she retrieves her oracle. old worn cards of tarot. From the sun tained backs and faded ink the cards seemed especially old.
To wendy, this age only enhanced her estimation that these thin cards contained much wisdom.

circuling thestck around the deck, to incase it in a ring of smoke. Wendy annoited her oracle, and placed her palm on her deck. Closing her eyes she
focused. On her desire. 
Oh, oracle, wendy said. You know what lies ahead of me today, please give me wisdom for what ever lies aahead of me today.
She shuffled her deck and spilt the deck in half one last time. She drew the card.
Two of Cups in reverse.

Two of Cups? wendy furrowed her brow and focuesed on it's art. The card depicted two persons thought to be lovers exchanging their grials in 
contened expressions shown on there faces. 
The card symbolzed partenership, compatibility, love, engagement.

Now wendy drew the reverse of this, the card upside down. In tarot, to draw a card upside down changed the way in which an individual was to interpret the symbol.
Typically, the reverse of a card suggested a reading which was opposite or at the very least complementary to the card's typical meaning.

Wendy sat the card down and frowned as she pondered this.

The opoosite of partenship, the reverse of paretenship of peace a need. Wendy frowned.
So is tarot suggesting lonliness? She chuckled. She didnt need to consult an oracle to know that.

She picked up her book on tarot meanings and tumbed throught the pages till she reched the page on the two of cups. 

The two of cups can also mean a need to focus on one's relatonshoip to ones self...

What could this me?
While never questioning or unaappreciating of the wisom reveled by the cards, wendy sighed as she read this.
It seemed an unfortunate omen. Lonlieness.... An omen that she would meet anyone during her secret misson to the library today?

She sighed. But after putting away her cards determindly started packing her things anyway. She slipped on her old red hoodie which she wore everyday.
And slung her heavy bag over her sholder. It was still early but the early the better for seeing to her mission today. 

Silently she crept out of her room, into the living area. Hereing a sharp metalic, crunch under her feat Wndy observed the empty beer bottles strewn across the floor.

Walking by the sofa she found David miserably spead out across the sofa. bottle still in hand.

I guess the date didnt go well huh?
Wendy said her voice  tinged with a saddened disgust.

She shifted her pag and silently slipped throught the door.

2.

Wendy walked down the street for 20 minutes. As the sun crept up the sky, the clouds became ornaments on a canvas of all shades from 
vilet to red

The heavy set bag weighed down on Wendys shoulders. She constantly shifted around the straps to avoid the havy strain.
The jupiter middle school was not the closest school nearby, but after an unfortiunate bullying incident two years ago, 
It was selected as wendys best choice when entering middle school.

At any rate, the walk would take an hour, but at least at this point wendy was halfway there. 
Her plan required stleath and so required an early start.
// I forgot the scene where wendy decides to try to locate the ghost once and for all.
Wendy was lonely wendy was after all different from most girls her age.
When wendy first met Liz she couldnt imagine that Liz was anything more than a case study.
An animal to be studied. Nerdious outcastus. A rare speciemen.
// I think I get the distance now, the narration sounds nothing like wendy. The narrator is not wnedy.
// What would different style of narration feel like?

Over time, however, Wendy was suprised to find what she thought was something like a kindred spirit in Liz.
Liz had been thrileed to meet a real witch, and wendy was peased as a peach to have someone to share her knowledge
of all things magical with. 
Not that there where never times where Liz seemed bogged down with Wendy's diatirbes into the paranormal.
It seemed to be going more or less well until Wendy started hearing it. and it seemed to be the fina straw.

It was only three months ago but to wendy it felt almost the like something that had plagued her for years.

The shrieking haundt that echoed through out the school towards the cloe of everyday.
The earthereal  howl that echoed from the schools library.

Wendy had practiced whichcraft from a young age, that tradition along with her worn red hoodie, were the sole possessions left to wendy by her mother.

Wendy had prectised the craft in isolation from a young age, and while she liked to believe she had had her fair share of experiences 
that touched upon the ordinary there was never something so sudden that gripped her.

Wendy had bothered to ask and as far as she could tell she wwas the only one in all of Jupiter who could hear thte dicrete howl.
As clear as a bell. The sound so distinnct and unlike anything wendy had ever heard.

Even wendy began to doubt when she found that Liz could not hear it. Here hearing was perfectly normal as far as she and the school nurse could tell.
It took wnedy some time to realize that only she could here the sound and that it wasnt all part of some elabort prank to 
mence the wicked witch.

Wendy would spend an hour in the library after school everyday, casting spelss trying to make contact.

A sound so ethereal so other worldly, could only belong to a ghost. 
A banshee she reasoned. A sort of disembodied ghost.

Wendy did her research, and attemtoed all known ways to soothe and communicate with such an apprition. To no avail.

The daily attempts at communication wore down Wendy, and ironically, only served to further isolate her.

Well, I'm going to go ahead and head home wendy. See you whenever... Liz would say. Unammused by Wendys growing fixation on the ghost
// I want to open the story with wendy staunchly trying to deny any interest in the ghost and Liz vexxed by the whole ordeal.

Everyday, ghost this haunt that. I really think you should see an ear doctor wendy. Or a psychologist at the very least.
Wouldnt ear doctor be the very least.

Wnedy had three main theories: 1) the ghost hell bent on tormenting specifically wendy,
3) she evidently had a superior doglike sense of hearing whch allowed here to hear things normal humans couldnt
4) there was something the ghost wasnt ready to communcate yet or was unleast undecided on what to say next
Well, and there was always the possibilty that she had just lost her marbles 
But for now, 3 was her working theory.

As far as wendy knew she had done everything possible to inititiate communcation with a banshee.
It was ultimately up to the ghost the make the next move.
Though wendy liked to think of herself as patient, the past months had been draining, and the concern with Liz
had been the final straw. Wendy was going to wait in the library all day if she had to, and if the ghost didnt have anything to say.
She was just going to ignore it from now on.

15 minuetes away from the school and the sun was already high in the sky. The sun started beating down and wendy was glad to know she'd be out of the sun soon.

Not far from the school wendy walked with her eyes to the ground as she contemplated her next move.

The first step would be to slip into the library. Wendy was comfident she'd find a way to do this as there was a series of doors that wendy knew were routinely
unlocked througout the school. 
The next move however still questioned wendy. How would wendy provoke the ghost to comminucate.
The specture was on a timeline, would it be fair to let it know this was the last chance? Or perhaps wendy had been to forceful.
Walking into the library casting spells attempting to communicate, perhaps listening and being receptive would be the best course of action.
Wendy contemplated these things, till a plastic wheeel ran direclty acroess her front foot.

And wendy shrieked out more from shock than in pain. catching herself from falling over Wendy looked up toe find her selof face to face with the culprit.

A small boy on a blue hollow plastic tricycle.

uh, heelo?
The boy stopped in front of wendy and stared at her blankly as he sloppiky sucked on a lolipop that seemed to be about as large as his head.

He kicked the peddle and the fron wheel was agin over wendy foot.

Hu, thaats my foot you know?
Wendy oulled back her foot and crept down to look at the boy.
Can you talk yet? The boy was very young looking to be about 4 or 5. Getting a better look at the Boy Wendy realized who it was 
// wendy is very affectionate towards young kids.
oh, its you! wendy smiled do you remember me?

Wendy bent over to picked the boy, who immediately grabbed hold of wendy as if she were his mother.
The intense stickines of his little fingers could be felt even throun wendys heavy jacket.

It's me wnedy! I babysat you and your older brother. Do you remember me?
// If wnedy is in middle school she isnt old enogh to baby sit.
Just as wendy said this, the sound of wheels dragged through gravel sounded and wendy looked around to find herlf surround 
by a formidable group of first graders. And from the look on their faces, they seemed less than hospitable.

Let my brother go you witch!

Wendy smiled, Hey Alex, how are you wendy said smiling?

I'm ok Alex said casually before shaking his head and looking at the other kids around him.
But but I need you to put my brother down. He isnt an ingreinet for you took cook in your witch's coauldron.

Are you sure she's a witch? a girl Madeline said next to Alex and pistione don her own trike.

She sure doesnt look like a withh. Dont witches have green skin and ride around on brooms?

// How will I introduce the boy who wants to hunt the ghost?

Wendy laughed still holding onto alexs brother. and shook her head.

No, no, real witches dont have green skin and fly aroudn on brooms. 
Witches dont need to look any sort of way to be witches.

So is it true that your a which? One of the other kids who had been silent spoke.

You bet! Wendy said with a sense of pride, much to shock of the children.

Can you cast spells? 
Everyday, wendy replied.

Well... Went madeline.. Why dont you cast a spell right now? That'll prove if youre a real witch or not.
Yeah cast a spell.
Make Timothy disapear, then tht'll prove if youre a real witch of not.

Wendy chuckled, exasperated.
But werent you trying to prevent me using my witchcraft on timothy?

Only make him disapear till it's time to go home, Alex said. Then you can bring him back.

I could defintely cast a spell, Wendy said, but I dont have time today, I'm in a bit of a hurry. And she sat timmy down next to his trike.

Were you headed off anyway Alex demeand.

Well, if you must know, I'm looking for a ghost.

Gohst?! The children gasped in unison.

Like a haunted mansion.

Library actually.

Like a white legless blanket over its head spook?

Probably not but I couldnt say for sure.

The they type of monster thatll posses you and control your soul forever?

Wendy shuddred. I hope not, she thought.

Wendy stepped forward and and placed her hand over her chest.
As a witch, she said, I see it as my duty to act as an itememidiary between the human world and the super natural.

// how can I introduce the ghost hunter boy? Is it alex? maybe, his little brother has been getting
// all the attention, and he thinks finding a ghost will bring him attention.

Alex squinted his eyes at wendy in skeptical fashion. 
Yeah, he scoffed, but what exactly makes you think you found a ghsot anyway, have you ever seen a ghost?

Well.. uh.. no wendy admitted. But the signs are all there! I'm a witch after all!
I have a sixth sense about these things.

A witch who cant cast spells, Alex repeated. 

Make timmy disapear he demanded
// maybe the other kids could explain to wendy that alex is grumpy that his little brother is getting all the attention
// or perhaps alex could get his own chapeter 

Well I need to get going Wendy said, rembering her mission.

The kids started heading while Alex stayed behind with a careful eye he watched wendy as she headed down the street.
// heres my issue: i'm not emeressed in the story.

One of Alex's friends Emily, stopped turning back she said, you coming alex? 

But alex didnt hear, in his head he envisoned himself, Alex the ghost hunter.
What if wnedy was ine to something? What if he could be there one to discover the ghost and reveal it to the world?

Hey, Emily, you mind watching timmy for a while? I want to go check on something...



--  Wendy goes to school to look for ghost if only for last time

Wendy's heavy bag made a loud thump as she dropped it on the ground before the school.

She had finally ariived. Exected she wiped her her sleeve against the drops of sweat on her 
forehead. Already exerted, but wendy realized she didnt have time to waste. Now was the real work to be done.
Step one of which was in fultrating the school's library.

She walked around the schhool yard to heaed to the door she had thought was left open.
She leaned forward to open the door when it flew open. Wendy shot back to avoid being hit.
For a split second she worried that her mission would be postponed but was realized when she was met with a familar face.
It was the school's janitor Janny.

Oh, Wendy, Glad to see you! He said and his bright smile somehow managed to increase the the wrinkles on his aged face.

Despite being a new student to Jupiter, wendy had know janny for as long as she could remember.
// Change school name to Harvey
He had been the janitor of wendy's middle school as well.

Headed to the library Wendy.

Janny said with a wide smile. 

haha.. I laughed nervously, Well I'm just walking around but if you wouldnt mind.

Janny, had let me stay late in the library a few times.
Even letting me stay past close saying just to make sure the door closes behind me.
I always just tell Janny I'm staying late to study and he seems more that welcoming to allow me.

Janny puts down his broom and I follow him inside.

He pulls the large ring of keys of off his waist and opens the libary door.

Stay as long as you'd like Wendy. Janny says eagerly.

It does my heart good to see a student working so hard Janny says as I place down my heavy bag of books.

I tell Janny I'm just studying at the truth is that while my reading hasnt been related to homework, I have been doing a fair share of research.

I sit down at one of the tables seated down at the center of the library and take out my notebook.

Janny starts making his wauy to the door.

I imagine you might be hear late Wendy janny says, just dont be working too hard. A girl your age needs to make time for her friends as well.

I drop my head down. Thanks Janny, haha to be honest, I like spending time alone with books.
Janny smiles, oh I you wont be here alone wnedy // I dont like this 

I finish pulling out my things and janny makes his way to the door.

Opening my book, I sgtared to read. Aticipating I might be here a while. The library door opens and I here janny call out.
Well, we all need someone to talk to at sometime, I turn my head to the door but see that Janny had already closed it behind him 
as he is nowhere to be sceen.

and return to my book before setting it back down.

"We all need to talk to somebody, when were ready.."

// what is something janny could say that eludes to the ghst?
// indicate that there might be someone else around?


Thump.

Ah
I jot my head up awake when one of the many heavy volumes I brought wirth me falls off the table.
I sit up, and see scarlet rays of light beaming through the window. Sundown already.
I sigh with a deep feeling of defeat. 10 hours...
I'd been sitting here to no avail.

I look despondent at the volmuios notes of letters scribbled into my notebook.
Nothing legible. All attempts at communicating with the ghost seemed fruitlesss.
I obviously have no nack for mediumship. 

I step up and peer out the windo towards the school parking lot. Not a single car or human soul in sight.
It then appears to me how lonely I feel within the library. a cold sensation shivers through my body and I rub my eyes for warcmth.

I cant stay here much longer I guess. I'm sure david will interegate me if I stay here too late.
I sigh, looking at the setting sun. Well I defintely gave it the old college try...

I look around the empty library sentimentally. 
Despite the lack of paranormal activit`y I still cant doubt it.
It's beyond rational explanation, but for reasosn I cant explain I know deep in the depths of my soul that somewhere inside this library.
There is a ghost, a sould, a supernatural enityt calling out pleading to be heard. But for whaterver reason not heard today.

A sympathetic smile spreads across my face and I decide to take a fial stroll around the musty beige metal shelves before leaving for the day.

I look at our schools modest collection of books under the section labled folklore.
I giggle when I see the mostly emptied shelf. As it stands most of the volumes that typically rest there are inside my back pack.

I decide to go ahead and grab my books from off of the table and start placing them on the shelf.
I'm figure I might as well do the librarian a favor, Emily. She's the only person who works in this library. I'm suprised she doesnt spend 
all day putting books away. I cant imagine how she does it.

I put away the volumes and placing down the final following the order indicated on the spine, I sit up and wipe my hands,
I think I'm doing it right. I stand up and wipe my hands.
// Wendy needs to have her books present to show casper. Well actually that comes later, when wendy knows casper is a ghost.

Heading to the door I take one last look at the library.
I smile. I start to think about the ghost haunting this library. How long had they been here?
How long had they even waited till someone came by who could hear them.
I thought about how long they might have waited. And here I was about ready to give up on the ghost.
I realize how selfish I'd been, to think of only myself. When I should have been here for the lonely lost soul.
"Whenever you want to talk... I'll be ready"


I say and start making my way out the door when it catches my attention.
The ambient howl, the ereal tune, the otherworldly song.

It's here. And it;;s not just here its here here.
As loud as ever, and for the first time I can pin point it. I dash into the darkened library almost tripping over one of the small seats.
I look up its coming from the second floor of the library, over in the section with all the picture books.
I get closer and start making my way through the shelves, I turn my head. There I say. I can hear it coming from behind one of the books 
shelves the area where all the picture books are.

The closer I get to the source of the noise the clearer it becomes. I creep forward and with every inch I make towards the shel the 
howl... it starts to lose its other worldly quality.
becoming less vibrant less myterious and more... Human?
It human. I approach the shelf and can here the heavy breathing the subtle wimpering a shiver comes 
through my body as I listen to the strained breathes. I realize I am not in the library alone. There is another person in the library in here with me.

It takes a real witch to feel more afraid of a huamn that a ghost.

My legs jolt and I have to fight the urge to run out of the library immediately,
but I cant stop now. After all this time after all time spent trying to find the source of this haunt.

EVen if it is just somebody who broke inside the libary and has been hiding here. I have to at least get a glane 
I have to at least take a look at the owner of this voice.
I have to see with my own eyes What ever lies behind that shelf is.
As silent as a mouse I bend down onto my knees in the darkend library.

And slowly slowy peer past the bookshelf

I squint my eyes to make out the figure in the dimly lit library. Do my eyess deceive me?

I see a boy... A boy about my age... and he's cryig...

Hundled into the corner. He pressing his chest against his knees. Shaking he he whimpers violents its a pathetic sight.

I feel so diarmed by his feeble appearance that without even think I stand and walk past the shelf.

the the boy lloks up briefly and looks in my direction, strangely he pays me no mind and continues his maning.
As if my appearance means nothing to him.
What a strange boy I think and take in his freatures.

His hair is light blonde like mine as before I dyed it. and long enough on the sides to reach the nip of his neck.
His skin is rudy and slightly freckled as if he spends many hours in the sun.

his clothing is stangre. A worn plaid shirt with even ruddier slacks held up by suspends that run up his back and across his shoudlers.

He looked like a boy straight out of a farmers story book.
Curious about the boy a take a few steps forward, still quielty.

I begin to wonder why such a boy is doing in this librayr so late.

Then it occurs to me, is this boy lost? Homeless?
The pieces are starting to come together.
Perhaps this boy had ran away from home. And he'd been hiding in the library after school. 

the the boy lloks up briefly and looks in my direction, strangely he pays me no mind and continues his maning.
As if my appearance means nothing to him.

He remains in his slumped position. Showing no indication of moving feeling more at I approach the boy.

Hey... I let out weakly but he pays no mind
// maybe casper is mumbuling something under his breathe? Going on about something
// Wendy thinks what casper is saying is pathetic not that his appearance is pathetic

Hey. I speak more loudly. I get no response.
He continues mumbling under his breath "..."
Is it possible he cant hear me?
I lean down towards the boy and lean foward hey I say again and wave at him slowly
// casper is sitting at a table
This time he looks at me, in disbelief

yoo hoo I smile and continue waving.
he looks behind himself almost as if he expects to see someone there then back at me.
Yes you I m talking to you.

You were crying... I say and sit across from him at the table. Is everything ok?...

He stares at me wide eyed his eyes puffy from his earlier tears.

He looks back behind himself then back to me.. He does this a few more times before 
finally opening his mouth.
you can see me? his says as he points his shaking finger towards himself.

I cant help but laugh. I cant help but find The boys nervousness and shock funny, 
yes I can see you. I giggle.

He waves his hand in a slow methodical manner. I raise my hand to follow his I lean forward to clap his hand but he qucikly widrws.

But how can you see me?

Because i have eyes? I say still laughing at the ruddy boys shock.

he puts his hand to his chins and seems to deeply ponder this.

Amusment aside, I remember the state of the situation and my smile  turns cold as I think on the sitiuation of this 
gritty, despondent boy.


You were crying earlier.. I say
Who me? he says defensively and rbus his sleevs across his eyes.
I think I just had something in my eye. He straightens his body as a sort of macho facade pails over.

It must be a sensitve topic. Just about anyboy would feel ashamed to be seen crying and I cant imagine this one is any exception.

So... What are you doing here the boy says seeming to want to schange the subject. Do you uh come to the library often?

Yes I say curiously, thrown of by the boys akward attempt to change the topic.

I want to ask the boy all the improtant questions why is he here, how long he's been here, if he needs a place to go.
But I resist the urge. After all, this boy is in all likliehood in a rather strange situation.
Who am I to him that he would reveal hi secrets so quickly.

I take the bait I'm willing to follow this conversation whereever its headed.

I'm a student here, I say you?

I'm not sure... He says apearing confused. I think I used to be.

How do you not know, I respond.

I think I used to be?

Used to be?

This boy couldntg be much alder than me, for all I know he could be younger.

whats your name he asks again chnging the subject.

Wendy... Good.

Your last name is good? he says.

Yeah, its my mothers last name its what I prefer to go by anyway.

You dont go by your fathers last name? He says suprised.

I shake my head, My father isnt around. 
Casper gives a long pause I'm sorry.. he says his face filled with genouine sympathy
At that moment I relaize something about this boy. He might be socially akward and easily frightend.. but he's he has a kind heart.

// do you lie books? // casper doesnt know how to read. 6/7/24

Well?

We;;?

Whats your name

Oh, he gasps seeming to remember his original question.
My name is Casper. Casper McFadden.

Casper huh? I say and smile. Thats a cute name. Casper blushes at this eveb redder than he was before and averts his eyes.
Mcfadden ... hmm I muse. That a pretty unusual name. Cant say I ever heard a name like that before.

its weird isnt it? casper says embarsessed. 
Its unique I say. I love it?

Really? yeah, I rpely. Unique things are the best thungs about us.

I turn my head from side to side and lean forward.

Come hear I'll tell you a secret.
Casper leans his long scrwny body over the table anticpiation writen upon him.

Theres actually another reason I'm here: I'm on a secret mission...
a mission for what? 
/// going with another plan

So, Casper... I say searching again for the words. Is everthing alright? You seemed pretty stressed when I first saw you.

oh, casper gasps and composers himself he looks away and thinks for a moment. I guess i was thinking about a lot.. He lets out.
His voice trailing.

Hoping to lighten the mood I look to casper wait right here I say I'll be right back.

Casper waits patiently as I run back to grab my bag and drop it on the table.

the heavy bag makes a loud thud as I place it on the table. Unzipping it, I start to pull out my my things.
Around the table I place a series of candles and from trusty pocket if my hoodie I pull out my trust wany which I flick 
about aove the flames make them dance with every flick of my wrist.

Casper sits back hey... what are you doing he says wide eyed.

I'm going to cast a spell.

A spell!? he exclaims. bbbut hhow can you cast a spell.

OH I realize, I duidnt tell you did I? I'm a witch.

A witch! casper shoots up and falss to the floor.

He lands on his back and starts to crawl backward.

So jumpy . I step forward and place my wand on the table.

A witch your a witch! he exclaims back ing up to the wall that explains everything thats why you can see me.

I place my wand on the table and raise my hands up pleading. Looks casper, we dont have to cast a spell.
I didnt know it would scare you look I put the wand down already.

having reached up the tha wall casper curls into a bacll and hands over his head returns to his original hysterics.

A witch a witch I should ave know. Oh now what if she takes my sould waht if she sends me to the underworld, Or worse.

Wahts even worse than the underworld? I 

The mumbling continues as casper curls into a ball.

And just when I thought this was someone I could talk to.

A witch a witch, I should have known after all this time to think...

I look down at the boy, Casper, I'm still so confused by it all.
Is this really the source of the noises I'd been hearing? 

The etherail howls that echoed from the library everyday? 
Could casper have caused that?
And perhaps more importandly , how long had casper been here anyway. 
Stood up from the table and inched my way slowly towards the nervous casper.

What if there was a ghost? What if there still is a ghost?
What the specture trying to help me find this boy? How had nobody else ever seen him.

Perhaps... perhaps that was it. This is the first time I've seen casper, I seen casper.
But maybe the same isnt true of others people. This scruffy distressed boy. How many times had he been in the same shape I'd seen him in before.
As I look at the boy in his frantic state, I cant bring myself to imagine that this boy has someone to reach out to when in need.
You must be all alone just like me... I say under my breath to the unrecogniving casper.
Perhaps that's why the specture thought to bring us together.

I reach down and to take caspers hand to get him to stand...

Look casper I'm really-sorry its--

I'm stunned to silence as my hand passes right through his.


-- 	Wendy gets home late, understandably.
// So I am changing this scene. The next scene opens up on the next day sunday with wedny headed to the library.
SHe is going to explain to casper why he is here and share her plans to help hom.

-- Scene: Wendy Trys to Find Casper's unfiniushed Business.


As I arrive to the librar drenched in swet. I amke a lod thud as I drop my heavy bag on the library table and start 
Un loading my bags of its volumouns contents.

I look over at casper who is gazing at me from a distance in nervous anticipation.

Are you ready casper?

He gives a slight nod and begins to form a question before a lump in his voice seems to deprive him of his voice.

Good I say, and crack open one of my books.
Cause I have a lot of questions to ask you, I sit at the table across from the chair I pulled out for Casper as he takes a seat as well.

I lay out a notepad. Listen casper some of these questions may be difficult to talk about, and you dont have to 
any you dont wnat to but the more trust you can put in me the better I am able to help you

Casper figits looking iuncertain before nodding in assent.

Good I say again.

He stares at the books piled up on the table and a strange expression comes over his face I'm not quote sure what to make of.

You read all these bbooks? He said.
I nod. I did a lot of research casper. about ghosts when I started hearijng you casper. The moment I suspected that there was a ghost in this library.

I llooked into everything I could find related to hauntings, so that I could find a way to help you pass on.

You did al this.. for me. He says as a tender expression come sacross his face. He looks over at me making eye contact but only for a momet.

Of course I say, plasing my hand across my chest with pride. As a witch, It is my duty to communicate with paranormal entites such as yourself.
We are intemietaries between the natural world and what lies beyond it.
para...normal..?

Casper says slowly as if he'd neved heard the word before.

Things beyoond the normal: spectures, magical occurances, nature spiritys, and of course, lost ghosts such as yourself.

I say and playfully tap my finger against casper forehead allowing my finger to pass through, just to drive home the point.

Casper looks uneasy, but I suppose its a natural reaction to this unnatural situation. 
 I click my pen and gaze at casper ready to note his respones to the Ghost questionre tm. Lets begin .
 Casper sits up straight and attentive. The whole thing feels very formal, like a jonb interview. Which is an apt description of the situation.

 Now, casper, it is common knowleged by a ghost of a once living human a ghost such as yourself is always caused by the deceased having some
 unfinished business in the world. Something was left undine unsaid. The ghost you were unable to pass on 
 // casper doesnt want to pass on he is afraid to.
 Because you had been unable to make peace with some situation before you passed on. Our first order of business is to find your 
 unishined busness so that we can help your soul pass on in peace.

 I look at the still attentive casper. All the information seems very new and suprising to him.
 I guess nobody takes the time to explain these things to you when you pass on. 

 Now casper, what unifihed busness did you have left in life?

 Casper thinks and pauses. what do you mean.

 Like what unfishied busness did you have? Like was there anything you didnt do before you passed on that you still think about.

 Caspe thinks on this a long while.

 I never found the missing button to my trousers. He stands and displays the still missing button.

 Okay... I say... And how do you feel about that button.. Where do you think you left it?

 I I dont know. Casper says. These closthers were hand me downs. 
 I dont think I ever had the button.

 Okay would you like a new button? I could brong one here. 

 Casper shrugs his shoulders. my close are like the rest of me. I dont think youd be able topin anything to them.

 WOuld you be about peace then? Would it help you if you had another button, though?

 I dont really care casper said frankly
.
this is going to take a while I think.

I go down the list of questions.

Time and date of death. I look up to casper whos seems eager for the next question.

Casper at what time... I stop mid sentaence unable to bring myself to ask him such a blunt question.

Time of what caspers repeats.

I shake my head.

I just need to know what you remmebr. 

///
What I remember? Oh like how I died?

Casper says frankly. I'm suprised of all things he is able to talk about this with little emotion.

I fell into the river. Casper says.

You drowned?

He nods.

Casper  I'm so sorry. I say trying to conforent him.

he shakes his head. Dont worry. It isnt your fault.

casper says and there is a silence.

what on the day it uh happened were you trying to do. did you have any rgrets.

Cspers thinks not reallly nothing I can think of... I was waiting for someone at the river and while I was waiting I fell down.
///

Well is there anything else you rmember wanting?

casper thinks again. I wanted to be rich he says vainly.

Rich ok.... I say. Not sure if I could help you with that. And who doesnt want to be rich?

Did you feel like you couldnt pass on before you became wealthy?

I ask him. again casper shakes his head. I never expected I'd become rich he syas. I just wished I was. Part of me ven now does he says with a smile.
Though I guess I dot have much use for money now do I?

This isnt really going anywhere I think. and as I think my eyes wander around me.

Heay, I say, why did you chose to haunt this library? I say. and notice casper wince as I use the word haunt.

Why do I haunt this library? he says and I notice him wince as he says the word haunt. Making me almost regret I sued the word.

I really cant say. casper says. 

// I just fell in one day. casper says.

// maybe wendy can ask casper about his death then about his unfinsied business.

heh, he gives a light chuckle. Strange for me to be stcuk in a library of all places, considering the fact I never learned to read.

My eyes grow wide
and casper looks suprised.

What I say?

Thats it! I exclaim.

He still looks puzzeled. 

It all makes sense. Thats why you possed this library. You never learned to read! And you wanted to learned.

Casper puts his finger to his chin. Do you... Really think thats it? hos says quitely. as the words roll off 
his lips he seems convinced.

I guess that would make a lot of sense.

Well, casper I say, I'm not exactly this schools top student but I'm more than capable of teaching you how to read
if you let me.

Casper frowns. Well, i dodnt see the point now  he says meekly. Given I'm already dead....
Plus I dont think there any pijt in me reading anyway.
All the McFadden family is goo for is working the farm and plowing fields, my uncles used to say that.
And I wssnt even good at that! My uncles told me that too. 
Dense as rocks they used to scold me.

Look casper
I reach out to take capser hands in mine, only for them to pass through.
,
He looks up at me with a face that seems to say told you so.

I lean forward, look casper, The whole reason youre here is cause you werent able to make peace. 
It has nothing to do about being alive or dead, youre still here arent you, in spirit, you can still see me hear me Cant you.

Casper looks intrigued. 

Witches like me know the distinctions between alive and dead are only clear to people who dont know the full story.

But the reason your soul is here in this library is because there was still something you had to learn.. 
If you'd be will to learn casper, 0I'd love to teach you!

Casper thinks long and hard on this. He gives a faint smile, well, I dont know see the point, but...
If you really want to.

He raises his face and for the first time that day meets my eyes.

I'd thank you wendy, thank you.


--------

// Where do I want to go with the next scene?
// I think I'll skip ahead in time.
// Casper and wendy are havig a teaching seession and casper is starting to make real progress.
// Wendy gets hime late and is approaced by david.

// Wendy has her next session with casper and finds he is upset. 
// Casper reveals that he isnt sure he's ready to go.
// Does he tell wendy he loves her? 
// That would move the story along faster.
// If I need to flesh the scenes out more I can always do that .

R-r-rod. Caspers looks at me nervously.
I just give him the subtle nod of approval I know casper is waiting for.

He looks down at the book and traces across the letters with his fingers as he sounds out the letters that only a month ago seemed so foreign to him.

Tod got a cod with his rod.

He poitns at the picture an looks to me with a nervous smile.

Thats it!

Casper look at you! You finished you first book all by yourself.

Casper's face blushes bright red. I'm not sure about that he says and palces his arm against the back of his head.
I'm still looking at you after every few words just to make sure I'm saying them right.

oh, poppycock I say. Speaking a word I heard casper use nonchilantly just a week ago. I pushed my had towards his shoulder playfully 
only to see it pass through. iteractions like this have become a bit of a loke to us now.

You should be proud of yourself casper. You've been working really hard.
And the truth is he has. Every day befo0o0re I leave the library I would leave a picture of the alphabet and a story book open on the table.

Not being able to hold the book casper is left just to read what I leave him.

If I was in caspers situation I would feel disheartened. Casper, however, seems just as diligent as the most motvated student.

When I first started teaching casper
When casper said he didnt know how to read... That was an understatemnet.
When we first started, casper knew how to spell his name and a few simple words, but that was about it.
But now Casper seems to to have a pretty good understanding of the alphabet. At least for the most part.

Well, I'm not sure if I could even do it without you wnedy. I still struggle with some of the letters
like the bs and ds. Theyre so easy to confuse.

I think so Casper, I say. I'm sure youll get better at it though with more practice.

He smailes.

I'm sure youll be reading shakespere in no time! Casper!

Casper laughs but no the thought occuers to me.

Hey casper, what do you think? Now that your able to read? 

Like what about it?

Well, how do you feel? Do you feel at peace per chance.

Casper places his hand to his chin in thought. I guess I feel better yeah, better wendy.

It's nice to now how to read. He says. Though not taht I'm eveb be able to read these books. Not unless you turn the pages for me.

And yet... Youre still here.

Casper frowns. Yes he says. sadly. almost as if he was guilty. I guess I am.

I look around the library.

I thought that was there reason youre here. I say. In this library. SO you could learn to read.

As far as casper is concerned he went from being ileterate to being a full fleged reader. 
He may not be ready for high school level books but if that was the issue... Why is his sould still attached to this library.

Hey casper I say to the guilty ghost who had his head turned down.

Can you think of any other reason youd be here in this library?
You said you didnt go to school here right?

I didnt go to school casper says bluntly. 
I jsut worked on the farm my uncles owned. They said I had no business going to school if I was just going to work the farm.

Did you ever want to go to school..

Casper thinks. I mean sure I did I thought abput it, but I figured the same thing with reading. 
I figured What was the pint if Ii was just going to alway work on my uncles farm.

I think on this Casper but did you want to work your uncles farm?

Casper seemes suprised when I ask him this and he struggles to find the answer despite being a very obvious no.

Well, I dodnt want to. I put put my pen down on the questionearie and sit next to casper.
Casper, I say, why dont you tell me.

Tell me more about you.

I'd love to learn.

-----


I finally get home late around 10pm.
I slip through the door way as silently as possible. Davids home but if I'm quite I should avoid waking him up.
Thankfully he works very early and is always asleep at this time of noight.

I slowly cloe the door behind me and start creeping towards room.

Home late again wendy. I look to my side I failed to notice David, who was siitng on our old arm chair drink in hand.

Late night at the library again his says with a scoff. With your frind right?

Yes.. I say bitijng my tongue before I say anything further. From davids tone I can only imagine he's thinking all sorts
of wrog things.

Without a doubt a boy right? Well you do take after your mother after all.

At the mention of mom I stop in my tracks, I turn an look at david. Mother has been gone 11 years and yet there hasnt been
a day I've spoken to David that he hasnt had something awful to say about her.

I hear the sound of a beer can crumble and David lights a cigeratte.

Your mother liked to stay out lights nights with boys too I guess you come by that naturally he says.

Casper isnt just some boy, David, I say with emphasis which doesnt seem to reach David. He's my friend and he needs my helo
you have the wrong Idea I say. Tears welling me eyes.

David leans forward and raises his voice. Then Why doesnt casper come over here? Himm he sighs.

Casper casnt he cant be here?

David raises an eyebrow. Why? Cause I might find something out about this casper you dont want me to?
Cause you dont want  e to find out what you two do together?

No David, I say glaring. 
You have no idea what youre talking about. I say.
Casper's just a sweet boy going through a hard time I say. And I could bring him here I would.

David just leans back in his chair un amussed. Hey non of your business right? David says with a sour tone.
Like it or not wnedy I am you dad, and after your mother left me with you you became my responsibilty.

I-dont expect you to appreciate that our to actually listen to anything I say, but I have to at least ask.
David iummediately turn from me and picks up the remote to turn on the TV.

I stand in place. I'm tired of this tired of these accustaions against me tired of him saying such awful things about my mother.


David looks toward me. from the TV did you need something?

You can say whatever you want about me, but for my mothers sakes cant you have some respect for the deceased? I say and
stare david straight in the euye.

David's eyes meet mine. It looks as though hes about to say something before he stares back at the TV. 

A moment passes and I trun to start heading towards my room.

By the way wendy, be ready next friday, your aunts are stopping by they said they want to spend the evening with you.


-----
SCENES:
What happens now?
* Wendy continues to try to help caspers soul find peace. 
* Casper mentions never kissing a girl before.
* Wendy opens up more to wendy. // I feel like this should have happened already.
* Wendy goes to see her aunts and is invited to live with them.
* Wendy decides to stay for casper.
* Casper admits he doesn want to leave, and that he loves wendy.
* A boy shows up and casper becomes possessive.
* Casper acuses Wendy of not caring for him.


Scene: Wendy continues to try to help caspers soul find peace. 

// what are things I wanted to happen that havent happened yet?
// That casper commited suicide waiting for someone.
// That caspers uncles were abusive.
// Wendy wants to learn more about Casper.

So far, Casper is giving very serious jude St. Francis vibes. I think I have unintentionally channeled that character
as I have written. There are similarites, but they are different. For one, I think casper is more emphathetic and less jaded.

// for now the plan is for them t read charlettoes web.

I wipe tears from my eyes, oh, casper isthat a beautiful story? 

I ook to my side I didnt even notice casper who was bowling his eyes out as I turn over the last page to the back cover over the book.
He continues sibbing seeming to forget I was sitting right next to him.
