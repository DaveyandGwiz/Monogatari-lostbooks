* 	Wendy hears a “ghost” in the school’s library

Uhhhh, earth to Wendy. Elizabeth said and snpped her fingers in Wendy's face.

Oh, ha-ha, Wendy awkwardly chuckled coming out of it and looking again at Elizabeth.

You heard it again, didnt you? 
Wendy rolled her eyes around nervoously. Uh,no?

Elizabeth and Wendy had stopped dead in their tracks; they stood in front of the exit of Jupiter middle school.
the bell had rung and studnts around manuevred around the duo as they made their way out. Easger to enjoy the long weekend.

Elizabeth paid them no heed. and elizabeth squinted her eyes as she focused on wendy.

Just thinking, huh? And what were you thinking about? Was it ghosts, per chance?

No no, wendy said nornvouly. She rattled the toy box of her inner mind trying to come up with an convincing alternative.
I was just thinking...about the ritual!
About the ritual? Oh, the spell?

Ritual. Wendy corrected her. Not exactly a spell. A spell always has an intention to effect the world around you. A ritual
is just a performance, a way to communicate with the divine. 
// good place to stop I need to figure out what wendy had invited Elizabeth to do. Some kind of ritual. That's the word I should use: ritual.
Uh huh. Elizabeth gave a unipired nod.

They started walking. Wendy slung her backpack over her shoulder  and gave it a proud slap, emphazizing it's fullness.
Are you excited, I'm ready to go straight to you place if you are ready. I'm sure if you wanted to stop by the smoothie shop before
heading home, I dont have any money right now, but I dont mind coming along. I'll just give you moreinformation in  prpearation 
for the ritual. I on,y gave you the bare monimum last time. But there's so much more to it!

Uh, huh. Elizabeth aknowledge somewhat exaperated.

Just then, as Elizabeth and Wendy approached the curb, a convertable pulled up several girls in there same grade started waving
At elizabeth of course.

hey, Liz, come on, you coming or what?

Elizabeth turned to Wendy, Hey wendy sorry I forgot I made plans to hand out with Emily and her friends tonight,
we're going Ice skating. Hope we can do the spell later?

Wendy forced herself to smile. It's no problem Liz. Yeah, can do the ritual later.

Without another word elizabth ran forward and hopped in the back of the convertbel. The girls slidng out of the way to make room for her.

The car pulled off the girls giggling as they sped forward. Wendy suspected some of the laughs might have bben directed at her,
not that would be anything new.

Wendy watched the car drive off forlornly. Wendy understood that things came up, and she had no trouble doing the ritual later.
But couldnt have liz asked wendy if she wanted to go?

Wendy shook her head, the fact that a girl as popular as Liz would hang out with Wendy at all was something she was grateful for.
At jupiter middle school there werent exactly a lot of kids willing to a associate with a witch.

ahhhh.

Then wendy heard it again.

She turned back towards the school at could see the staff closing up for the day. 
On the outside, everything apppeared normaly at least to other people.
// i'd like wendy to find a bench to sit on or something. Maybe could work on a spell/tarot or something.
It was almost 5pm and most of the students had left at this point. The parking slowly emptied, and what few indivudals were by
carried on as they normally do.

Not a single one of them could hear what wendy heard: the long lound haunting howl.
How it echoed from outside the school like  the alarm system was off.

no matter how many times wendy heard it she couldnt bring herself to ignore it. How could she? With it's otherwordly howl
the very sound of which shook wendy to her core.

Wendy frowned and looked at her phone to check the time.
