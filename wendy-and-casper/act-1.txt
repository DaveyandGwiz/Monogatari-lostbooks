 Elizabeth said snapping her fingers.

 Haha, yeah sorry you were saying?

* 	Wendy hears a “ghost” in the school’s library

Uhhhh, earth to Wendy. Elizabeth said and sanpped her fingers in Wendy's face.

Oh, ha-ha, Wendy awkwardly chuckled coming out of it and looking again at Elizabeth.

You heard it again, didnt you? 
Wendy rolled her eyes around nervoously. Uh,no?

Elizabeth and Wendy had stopped dead in their tracks; they stood in front of the exit of Jupiter middle school.
the bell had rung and studnts around manuevred around the duo as they made their way out. Easger to enjoy the long weekend.

Elizabeth paid them no heed. and elizabeth squinted her eyes as she focused on wendy.

Just thinking, huh? And what were you thinking about? Was it ghosts, per chance?

No no, wendy said nornvouly. She rattled the toy box of her inner mind trying to come up with an convincing alternative.
I was just thinking...about the ritual!
About the ritual? Oh, the spell?

Ritual. Wendy corrected her. Not exactly a spell. A spell always has an intention to effect the world around you. A ritual
is just a performance, a way to communicate with the divine. 
// good place to stop I need to figure out what wendy had invited Elizabeth to do. Some kind of ritual. That's the word I should use: ritual.
Uh huh. Elizabeth gave a unipired nod.

They started walking. Wendy slung her backpack over her shoulder  and gave it a proud slap, emphazizing it's fullness.
Are you excited, I'm ready to go straight to you place if you are ready. I'm sure if you wanted to stop by the smoothie shop before
heading home, I dont have any money right now, but I dont mind coming along. I'll just give you moreinformation in  prpearation 
for the ritual. I on,y gave you the bare monimum last time. But there's so much more to it!

Uh, huh. Elizabeth aknowledge somewhat exaperated.

Just then, as Elizabeth and Wendy approached the curb, a convertable pulled up several girls in there same grade started waving
At elizabeth of course.

hey, Liz, come on, you coming or what?

Elizabeth turned to Wendy, Hey wendy sorry I forgot I made plans to hand out with Emily and her friends tonight,
we're going Ice skating. Hope we can do the spell later?

Wendy both shocked and dispointed looked at the car and back at liz before forcing a smile
 forced herself to smile. It's no problem Liz. Yeah, can do the ritual later.

Without another word elizabth ran forward and hopped in the back of the convertbel. The girls slidng out of the way to make room for her.

The car pulled off the girls giggling as they sped forward. Wendy suspected some of the laughs might have bben directed at her,
not that would be anything new.

Wendy watched the car drive off forlornly. Wendy understood that things came up, and she had no trouble doing the ritual later.
But couldnt have liz asked wendy if she wanted to go?

It wasbt as if wendy expected it, but would it have killed Liz to invite Wendy once?
Not that she had any inteest in hanging out with a bunch of girly girls anyhow.

Wendy shook her head, the fact that a girl as popular as Liz would hang out with Wendy at all was something she was grateful for.
At jupiter middle school there werent exactly a lot of kids willing to a associate with a witch.

Wendy lloked back at the school grounds plotting her next step, it seemed that the plans for the evening had been changed.
But going home wasnt an option, and how could she waste this opprotunity to cast under the new moon? 
-------------------------
The school grounds had about cleared comepletely at this point 
// I missed the beat about the new moon.
Then wendy heard it again.

She turned back towards the school at could see the staff closing up for the day. 
On the outside, everything apppeared normaly at least to other people.
// i'd like wendy to find a bench to sit on or something. Maybe could work on a spell/tarot or something.
It was almost 5pm and most of the students had left at this point. The parking slowly emptied, and what few indivudals were by
carried on as they normally do.

Not a single one of them could hear what wendy heard: the long lound haunting howl.
How it echoed from outside the school like  the alarm system was off.

no matter how many times wendy heard it she couldnt bring herself to ignore it. How could she? With it's otherwordly howl
the very sound of which shook wendy to her core.

Wendy frowned and looked at her phone to check the time.  
----------------------------

The sound of the rushing crowds subsided, leaving a desolotae parking lot in its place.
The school grounds had cleared and what few individuals were there consisted primarly of staff locking up doors and leaving for the day.

There was a lump in her throuat and she sat down her bag to cover her ears. She looked at the main enterance as the janitor shut the door 
for the day, carrying on as there was nothing unusual. To him there likely was nothing that seemed out of the ordinary.
Only wendy could hear it: The loud long ambient screech, its haunting, uneartlhy howl that eminated from the library.

Only she could hear the ghost that haunted Jupiter middle school.



---------

// Wendy goes out to the park in the woods.
// how does she prepare her spell? Does she light a fire?

A new moon.

Wendy looked up at the night sky a fresh ensusiaium.
She had been looking forward to this night for months now. // I'm just going to make stuff up for now. Get the feeling down. 
The new moon provided the hight of magical power for a witch like wendy at least for the type of spell she had planned to cast.
// I want to work on the through line of the lonliness and the ghost. Right now things feel dijointed but that happens, doesnt it?

LOooking around her she found herself deep in the woods, with the only company being the night sky. She had planned on using this location,
but had planned to be accompanied by Liz. Standing out in the woods by herself, wendy felt uneasy, but the sight of the new moon gave her a 
sense of renwed courage. She had a purpose a divine one.

The appearance of a new moon marked the beggining of the nxt lunar cycle. It was a new beggining, and a good little witch like wendy 
new that such a night was the opprotune chance to cast a such a spell.
 A spell that marked a new beggining.

 Wendyy took from her bag a sereis of stones and ith them formed the star of david a holy symbol acknowledge by magic users.

 she took the insnse from her bag, hoolywood leavs, myrr, and a dash of cinnamon, wendy smiled as she took a long breath of the sweet herbs 
 before striking a match and light a candle to place on the center.
 in her palms she held two simple metal rings. she outstretched her open palms over the flam nd let the smoke putify the rings.

 One ring was for wendy and the other was for liz. At least it was going to be.

 Tonights spell the product of many hours of comtemplation of wendy was a ritual to both celebrate the beging of there friendship and
 to ask the goddess of the moon to bless and preserve it.

 Wnedy stretched her open palms outward to the moon goddess. 

 A subtle frown spread across wendys face. She had memorized the mantra, but now she wasnt sure.
 This Was the spell to cast friendship but was Liz that friend. Here she was in the woods to cast a spell to bless a friendship 
 only one friend was not here. Wendy kept her palms outstretched and stared up to the moon pleadingly.

 A wish was on her lips, but she could not explain it.

 The longing for friendship with Liz or really just a friend of some sort, a friend who could understand her, who would need her like she
 needed a friend.

 Not to mention the haunting at her school!

 // I want to go back to something close to my original beggining. Liz is quite vexxed about wndy hearing the ghost, and they discuss it.

 // It becomes clear through their conversation about the ghost that Liz is quite vexxed, only hu,ors wendy, and wendy is quite obseessed.
 // Wendy wants to stop bringing up the ghost she fears it is pushing Liz away. It only makes her more strange.

 Her firnedship with Liz, if liz even was her firnd, her need for a friend, not to mention the hauntinng at school.
 Wendy stared into the night sky pleadingly.

 What could she ask the moon godess for? What should she ask.

 She took a deep breathe and dropping her script spoke from her soul.
// let me be a friend, to someone in need.  to let the lonely time end, so mote it be!
 

 -- Later that noght or the next day.

 // Does wendy wake up? Or does she go home late? 
 If she goes home late, the scene settles down. 
 If she wakes up, then we carry on to Wendy leaving to the school and meeting the kids 
// I'll go with the later.

Wendy rubbed at her eyes. She felt

Feeling wide-awake she stood up from her bed. looking out the blinds she observed the darkness outside. She turned to her clock 3:35am.
much earlier than she planned to get up, perhaps it was divine providence.
Feeling wide awake she went ahead and got out of bed. turning to her small cubby desk she turns on her lamp and lights a stick of insence
matching for an early saturday morning. She pulls out a small wooden box with a symbol engraved on it; she consoles her orcale.

from the box, she retrieves her oracle. old worn cards of tarot. From the sun tained backs and faded ink the cards seemed especially old.
To wendy, this age only enhanced her estimation that these thin cards contained much wisdom.

circuling thestck around the deck, to incase it in a ring of smoke. Wendy annoited her oracle, and placed her palm on her deck. Closing her eyes she
focused. On her desire. 
Oh, oracle, wendy said. You know what lies ahead of me today, please give me wisdom for what ever lies aahead of me today.
She shuffled her deck and spilt the deck in half one last time. She drew the card.
Two of Cups in reverse.

Two of Cups? wendy furrowed her brow and focuesed on it's art. The card depicted two persons thought to be lovers exchanging their grials in 
contened expressions shown on there faces. 
The card symbolzed partenership, compatibility, love, engagement.

Now wendy drew the reverse of this, the card upside down. In tarot, to draw a card upside down changed the way in which an individual was to interpret the symbol.
Typically, the reverse of a card suggested a reading which was opposite or at the very least complementary to the card's typical meaning.

Wendy sat the card down and frowned as she pondered this.

The opoosite of partenship, the reverse of paretenship of peace a need. Wendy frowned.
So is tarot suggesting lonliness? She chuckled. She didnt need to consult an oracle to know that.

She picked up her book on tarot meanings and tumbed throught the pages till she reched the page on the two of cups. 

The two of cups can also mean a need to focus on one's relatonshoip to ones self...

What could this me?
While never questioning or unaappreciating of the wisom reveled by the cards, wendy sighed as she read this.
It seemed an unfortunate omen. Lonlieness.... An omen that she would meet anyone during her secret misson to the library today?

She sighed. But after putting away her cards determindly started packing her things anyway. She slipped on her old red hoodie which she wore everyday.
And slung her heavy bag over her sholder. It was still early but the early the better for seeing to her mission today. 

Silently she crept out of her room, into the living area. Hereing a sharp metalic, crunch under her feat Wndy observed the empty beer bottles strewn across the floor.

Walking by the sofa she found David miserably spead out across the sofa. bottle still in hand.

I guess the date didnt go well huh?
Wendy said her voice  tinged with a saddened disgust.

She shifted her pag and silently slipped throught the door.

2.

Wendy walked down the street for 20 minutes. As the sun crept up the sky, the clouds became ornaments on a canvas of all shades from 
vilet to red

The heavy set bag weighed down on Wendys shoulders. She constantly shifted around the straps to avoid the havy strain.
The jupiter middle school was not the closest school nearby, but after an unfortiunate bullying incident two years ago, 
It was selected as wendys best choice when entering middle school.

At any rate, the walk would take an hour, but at least at this point wendy was halfway there. 
Her plan required stleath and so required an early start.
// I forgot the scene where wendy decides to try to locate the ghost once and for all.
Wendy was lonely wendy was after all different from most girls her age.
When wendy first met Liz she couldnt imagine that Liz was anything more than a case study.
An animal to be studied. Nerdious outcastus. A rare speciemen.
// I think I get the distance now, the narration sounds nothing like wendy. The narrator is not wnedy.
// What would different style of narration feel like?

Over time, however, Wendy was suprised to find what she thought was something like a kindred spirit in Liz.
Liz had been thrileed to meet a real witch, and wendy was peased as a peach to have someone to share her knowledge
of all things magical with. 
Not that there where never times where Liz seemed bogged down with Wendy's diatirbes into the paranormal.
It seemed to be going more or less well until Wendy started hearing it. and it seemed to be the fina straw.

It was only three months ago but to wendy it felt almost the like something that had plagued her for years.

The shrieking haundt that echoed through out the school towards the cloe of everyday.
The earthereal  howl that echoed from the schools library.

Wendy had practiced whichcraft from a young age, that tradition along with her worn red hoodie, were the sole possessions left to wendy by her mother.

Wendy had prectised the craft in isolation from a young age, and while she liked to believe she had had her fair share of experiences 
that touched upon the ordinary there was never something so sudden that gripped her.

Wendy had bothered to ask and as far as she could tell she wwas the only one in all of Jupiter who could hear thte dicrete howl.
As clear as a bell. The sound so distinnct and unlike anything wendy had ever heard.

Even wendy began to doubt when she found that Liz could not hear it. Here hearing was perfectly normal as far as she and the school nurse could tell.
It took wnedy some time to realize that only she could here the sound and that it wasnt all part of some elabort prank to 
mence the wicked witch.

Wendy would spend an hour in the library after school everyday, casting spelss trying to make contact.

A sound so ethereal so other worldly, could only belong to a ghost. 
A banshee she reasoned. A sort of disembodied ghost.

Wendy did her research, and attemtoed all known ways to soothe and communicate with such an apprition. To no avail.

The daily attempts at communication wore down Wendy, and ironically, only served to further isolate her.

Well, I'm going to go ahead and head home wendy. See you whenever... Liz would say. Unammused by Wendys growing fixation on the ghost
// I want to open the story with wendy staunchly trying to deny any interest in the ghost and Liz vexxed by the whole ordeal.

Everyday, ghost this haunt that. I really think you should see an ear doctor wendy. Or a psychologist at the very least.
Wouldnt ear doctor be the very least.

Wnedy had three main theories: 1) the ghost hell bent on tormenting specifically wendy,
3) she evidently had a superior doglike sense of hearing whch allowed here to hear things normal humans couldnt
4) there was something the ghost wasnt ready to communcate yet or was unleast undecided on what to say next
Well, and there was always the possibilty that she had just lost her marbles 
But for now, 3 was her working theory.

As far as wendy knew she had done everything possible to inititiate communcation with a banshee.
It was ultimately up to the ghost the make the next move.
Though wendy liked to think of herself as patient, the past months had been draining, and the concern with Liz
had been the final straw. Wendy was going to wait in the library all day if she had to, and if the ghost didnt have anything to say.
She was just going to ignore it from now on.

15 minuetes away from the school and the sun was already high in the sky. The sun started beating down and wendy was glad to know she'd be out of the sun soon.

Not far from the school wendy walked with her eyes to the ground as she contemplated her next move.

The first step would be to slip into the library. Wendy was comfident she'd find a way to do this as there was a series of doors that wendy knew were routinely
unlocked througout the school. 
The next move however still questioned wendy. How would wendy provoke the ghost to comminucate.
The specture was on a timeline, would it be fair to let it know this was the last chance? Or perhaps wendy had been to forceful.
Walking into the library casting spells attempting to communicate, perhaps listening and being receptive would be the best course of action.
Wendy contemplated these things, till a plastic wheeel ran direclty acroess her front foot.

And wendy shrieked out more from shock than in pain. catching herself from falling over Wendy looked up toe find her selof face to face with the culprit.

A small boy on a blue hollow plastic tricycle.

uh, heelo?
The boy stopped in front of wendy and stared at her blankly as he sloppiky sucked on a lolipop that seemed to be about as large as his head.

He kicked the peddle and the fron wheel was agin over wendy foot.

Hu, thaats my foot you know?
Wendy oulled back her foot and crept down to look at the boy.
Can you talk yet? The boy was very young looking to be about 4 or 5. Getting a better look at the Boy Wendy realized who it was 
// wendy is very affectionate towards young kids.
oh, its you! wendy smiled do you remember me?

Wendy bent over to picked the boy, who immediately grabbed hold of wendy as if she were his mother.
The intense stickines of his little fingers could be felt even throun wendys heavy jacket.

It's me wnedy! I babysat you and your older brother. Do you remember me?
// If wnedy is in middle school she isnt old enogh to baby sit.
Just as wendy said this, the sound of wheels dragged through gravel sounded and wendy looked around to find herlf surround 
by a formidable group of first graders. And from the look on their faces, they seemed less than hospitable.

Let my brother go you witch!

Wendy smiled, Hey Alex, how are you wendy said smiling?

I'm ok Alex said casually before shaking his head and looking at the other kids around him.
But but I need you to put my brother down. He isnt an ingreinet for you took cook in your witch's coauldron.

Are you sure she's a witch? a girl Madeline said next to Alex and pistione don her own trike.

She sure doesnt look like a withh. Dont witches have green skin and ride around on brooms?

// How will I introduce the boy who wants to hunt the ghost?

Wendy laughed still holding onto alexs brother. and shook her head.

No, no, real witches dont have green skin and fly aroudn on brooms. 
Witches dont need to look any sort of way to be witches.

So is it true that your a which? One of the other kids who had been silent spoke.

You bet! Wendy said with a sense of pride, much to shock of the children.

Can you cast spells? 
Everyday, wendy replied.

Well... Went madeline.. Why dont you cast a spell right now? That'll prove if youre a real witch or not.
Yeah cast a spell.
Make Timothy disapear, then tht'll prove if youre a real witch of not.

Wendy chuckled, exasperated.
But werent you trying to prevent me using my witchcraft on timothy?

Only make him disapear till it's time to go home, Alex said. Then you can bring him back.

I could defintely cast a spell, Wendy said, but I dont have time today, I'm in a bit of a hurry. And she sat timmy down next to his trike.

Were you headed off anyway Alex demeand.

Well, if you must know, I'm looking for a ghost.

Gohst?! The children gasped in unison.

Like a haunted mansion.

Library actually.

Like a white legless blanket over its head spook?

Probably not but I couldnt say for sure.

The they type of monster thatll posses you and control your soul forever?

Wendy shuddred. I hope not, she thought.

Wendy stepped forward and and placed her hand over her chest.
As a witch, she said, I see it as my duty to act as an itememidiary between the human world and the super natural.

// how can I introduce the ghost hunter boy? Is it alex? maybe, his little brother has been getting
// all the attention, and he thinks finding a ghost will bring him attention.

Alex squinted his eyes at wendy in skeptical fashion. 
Yeah, he scoffed, but what exactly makes you think you found a ghsot anyway, have you ever seen a ghost?

Well.. uh.. no wendy admitted. But the signs are all there! I'm a witch after all!
I have a sixth sense about these things.

A witch who cant cast spells, Alex repeated.
