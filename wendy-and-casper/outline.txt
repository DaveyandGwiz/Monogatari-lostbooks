// I have really thought of Wendy as a seeker of the unexplained. She isnt a scholar on the history of Wicca. She probably conflates magic with psychics, deviation, supernatural, and New-Age type stuff (like The Secret).
 

SCENES:
	Wendy hears a “ghost” in the school’s library
	Wendy talks to her (banshee)
	Wendy and her friend (Elizabeth Hubard) talk about the secret (that book).
	Wendy avoids going home
	Wendy’s father has a date over
	Wendy goes to her room and reflects
	Wendy wakes up and casts a spell
	Wendy walks outside and is approached by kids in her neighborhood
	Wendy goes to school to look for ghost if only for last time.
	Wendy finds Casper, but doesnt realize that he is a ghost.
	Casper is surprised
	Casper was crying Wendy stops to talk to him.
	Wendy finds out Casper is a Ghost AFTER Casper learns Wendy is a witch.
	Wendy gets home late, understandably.
	Wendy is confronted by her father who accuses her of sleeping around, also he insults her weight.
	Wendy starts trying to help Casper’s soul find peace so he can pass on to heaven.
	They try various things (list some ides):
		*finishing a book.
		*learning to read.
	Wendy tries to learn more about Casper.
	He died () the school was built on the land his uncle's farm used to be on.

…	
Eventually Wendy and Casper kiss. This leads to them being in a relationship.
Over the holidays Wendy spends it with her relatives. She meets her Aunt (father’s side). Her Aunt, Bridget Bishop. 
Bridget brings her old dog, Opie, to the family meeting.
Bridget is single the concerned older sibling of Wendy’s father and cares for Wendy very much; they are close.
Later it is discussed that Bridget is willing to take Wendy to live with her. // Wendy has 3 aunts
Around this time Wendy and casper’s meetings become very sad. Casper constantly tries to up-play his own sadness and belittle Wendy’s. 
Wendy becomes Casper’s caretaker.
Wendy doesn’t tell Casper about her aunt.
Wendy’s father wonders why she doesn't move since she “hates him” (his words).
Wendy goes to highschool new boy, George buros, becomes interested in Wendy.
George follows Wendy to the library and Casper becomes jealous.
For sometime Casper disappears.
…
// Maybe George is one of the boys older brothers???
Wendy meets casper again and tells him how much she cares for him and how much she hates living with her father/school/ect.
Wendy cries and Casper tries to comfort her.
Casper passes on.
“For the first time in my life… I’m worried about someone other than myself… Wendy …. ”
