--  Wendy goes to school to look for ghost if only for last time

Wendy's heavy bag made a loud thump as she dropped it on the ground before the school.

I drop my bag to the pavement
My heavy bag makes a loud thump as it hits the pavement.
I finally arrived at Jupiter, almost noon alread the sun is high in the sky.
I use my sleeve to wipe the sweat from my brow.
Step 1 get to school now it onto step two. getting into the school.
Being saturday, the school is of course closed. But gievn the path I know, there should be a way onto the lobrary.
The only thing to worry about is not sneaking aroud to arosue supsision.

I pick my bag back up with a hea heave and toss it across my shoulder.

As I approach the entry door which is typically unlock I reach out my hand to take the handle.
the door then suddenly flies open and I am sent leaning back.

Oh, Wendy, good to see you! 

I'm met with the aged visage on Jonny, our schools janitor.

Here to study wendy? Off to the library no doubt.
Its a stroke of luck that of any of the people who would be here today it would be jonny.
