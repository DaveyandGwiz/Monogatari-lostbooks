5/5/

Not in the best mood today. Not sure what the issue is. A lot of things.
Fundamaentally, I feel at conflict with my story. Or maybe even why I am writing at all.
Tekkaman struggles with what it means to be a hero.
I struggle with the thought if I want to be a hero at all. If I even want to concern myself with others.
I have brought so much pain to my own life, I have even brought frustration to others lives.
WOuld it be better if I just lived within a biubble, isolated from society from others as much as possible.
Have I ever done anything heroic?
Or have I just ran into oppostion, worked very hard, suffered a great deal of distress, and most concerningly
not stood up for my own well-being when others were wont to take advantage?

Is being a hero even a noble goal?
Was I a hero at the nursing home? A hero at the animal sanctuary?
Was I a hero within my own home?

Would it have been better if I was 'selfish'?

I struggle.
