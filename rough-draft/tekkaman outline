Question: What is a hero?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tekkaman:_The_Space_Knight
Tekkaman the space
“Tekkaman is invincible”
Barry Gallagher cocky headstrong good at what he does
Samurai
Chosen to become tekkaman
A messenger is sent from the emperor
To tell them of the emporers coming
It challenges the world's mightiest hero and if they defeat him he lets the planet win
A way to weed out week planets
Uncle Bob was already scouting for other planets earth is over populated and dying of pollution
The emporer sends out drones to determine facts about the planet
Tekkaman needs to ride if they find him they will know how strong the planet is
The drones kill people
But Barry can't sit back and wait
Earth and Patricia are gone
The emporer will be heading to a nearby planet
The people of it live alongside nature like native tribes
Technology is a sin to them
They were once technologically advanced
But even primitive they are mighty
Barry trains alongside them
He needs to fight a battle inside
He sees the chief who is like a shaman
